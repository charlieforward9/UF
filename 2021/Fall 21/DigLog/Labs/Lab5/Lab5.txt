Prelab Questions

1. Left shift is equivalent to MULTIPLYING by powers of 2
2. Right shift is equivalent to DIVIDING by powers of 2
3. Logical shift right will replace the leading bit with a zero, which can jeopardize the value of the number if 2s compliment is used. Arithmatic shift right preserves the sign when shifted. Therefore, arithmatic shift right must be used when shifting a negative number
4. 256 possible operations
