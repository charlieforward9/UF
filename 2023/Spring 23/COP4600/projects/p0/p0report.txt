P0 - My First Kernel Mod - Report

Author: Charles Richardson

Description:  The task of this project was the modify text on the screen during the boot process, exposing us to the kernel code in a "low demand" manner. Modifying the text on the screen required writing to two separate files, described below:

*/init/main.c
	⁃This file was located by the function name given in the project documentation, rcu_end_inkernel_boot(). I was able to locate this using the grep -r "<txt>" command, with relative ease.  Placing the text on the screen posed an impediment as I did not remember to rebuild the kernel after modifying the file. This resulted in a long debug period. Upon learning the solution, I tested by relaunching the VM and visually inspecting the boot process.
* /mnt/sysroot/grub/menu.lst
	⁃This file was much harder to locate. I attempted to use grep -r "<txt>" on various keywords such as GRUB, MENU, BOOT, etc. Finally, I decided to stop looking for the text inside the file and settled on looking for a file name. I navigated to the root folder and called sudo find / -name "grub" , and the solution appeared. Upon making the change, testing was again performed visually.
* p0.diff
	⁃Generated by copying and pasting project spec code to create a difference between what the kernel had by default and what I added. 3 lines of difference.
